Eight of the gubernatorial seats up for grabs are now held by Democrats; three are in Republican hands. Republicans currently hold 29 governorships, Democrats have 20, and Rhode Island's Gov. Lincoln Chafee is an Independent. Polls and race analysts suggest that only three of tonight's contests are considered competitive, all in states where incumbent Democratic governors aren't running again: Montana, New Hampshire, and Washington.

The GOP currently controls 29 of the country's top state offices; it's expected to keep the three Republican ones that are up for grabs (Utah, North Dakota, and Indiana), and wrest North Carolina from the Dems. That brings its toll to 30, with the potential to take three more, reports NPR. Races in Montana, New Hampshire, and Washington are still too close to call, and in all three, Democrat incumbents aren't seeking reelection. The results could have a big impact on health care, since a Supreme Court ruling grants states the ability to opt out of ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion. \"A Romney victory would dramatically empower Republican governors,\" said one analyst.

Organizers say the event will be rescheduled for September or October. The memorial, the first on the Mall honoring an African American, has been a quarter-century in the making, but safety trumped ceremony. Irene was forecast to sweep over the coast overnight, and it's expected to weaken to a Category 2 storm by Sunday morning, reports AP. \"I'm disappointed and hurt, really,\" says the chief executive of the memorial project foundation. \"But the memorial is going to be there forever.\"",

The Category 3 storm is expected to hit the Southeast sometime tomorrow, and hundreds of thousands of residents have been ordered out of their homes in three North Carolina counties. Norfolk, Va., is also ordering residents to evacuate, and Washington, DC, has been forced to postpone Sunday's planned MLK Memorial dedication. \"This is a very, very serious situation,\" a spokeswoman for Dare County told ABC News. \"We have not seen anything like this in the lifetimes of most our residents. Once the storm hits, it will be very difficult to respond to distress calls.\" Irene is some 700 miles wide now and moving at a slow 12mph, which means it can wreak extensive damage in a region over a long period of time; it could cause up to $13.9 billion in damage on the East Coast. The storm is expected to barrel into New York City on Sunday, packing winds of up to 90mph. New Jersey communities are already being evacuated, and hundreds of street fairs have been canceled and elder care facilities and hospitals in low-lying area will be evacuated in New York today. NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg says residents in low-lying parts of the city should get out today as the transit system is planned to be shut down tomorrow."

The 23-year-old suffered a devastating knee injury in the third game of the season on April 7 and sat out the rest of the year. In a surprise move, the Cubs put him back in the lineup for the World Series as a designated hitter. After doubling in Game 1—one of the few bright spots for the Cubs that game, which came after TV analyst Pete Rose predicted he'd strike out three times—Schwarber had two RBI singles in the Cubs' Game 2 victory and scored another run himself. He's batting .429 with two walks. \"They're going to make movies about him,\" says teammate Kris Bryant. No position player has ever recorded his first hit of the season in the World Series. And his \"eye\" at the plate is astonishing his teammates, notes the Chicago Tribune. The problem for the Cubs is that Schwarber is not medically cleared to play the outfield, but that could change before Friday's game in Chicago, where no designated hitter is allowed. But \"the next plot twist— “Will Schwarbs be in left field?'—likely will not be a twist at all,\" writes Ken Rosenthal at Fox Sports. \"He will be in left.

Pictures on her Facebook and Formspring accounts look pretty close to the blurred images offered up on The Dirty when it broke the sexting story, and she's talked about Weiner quite a bit online (often on accounts that are now deleted).

I decided.\" Her TwitPic account identifies her as an Obama for America field organizer. She also listed Weiner as one of her heroes, wrote at least one blog post about his resignation, and said on Facebook that he shouldn't have resigned. An anonymous source confirms BuzzFeed got the ID right and says he or she saw the messages exchanged a year ago, but a BuzzFeed reporter asked Weiner last night if he knew Leathers and—shocker—got no response. The source, who says he or she has known Leathers since high school, says she \"felt she was the important one\" to Weiner, even more important than wife Huma Abedin. As for Abedin, Daily Intel notes that she came to a \"prescient conclusion\" in September's Harper's Bazaar: \"People have said many things about my husband—some nice, some not so nice. And that will surely continue. Launching this campaign was not an easy decision for our family to make.

Days later, she died of toxic shock triggered by the sepsis, reports ITV. \"If she'd been given the test and had her blood pressure taken when she first complained of feeling unwell I'm convinced she could have been saved,\" says her mother. Sepsis is a complication that can arise from an infection and, if untreated, quickly become life-threatening.

That Good Samaritan, Michael Long, also has a metal detector, and so when he heard about the lost ring, he \"thought it would just be nice to get up there, help a random couple out, and find the ring before someone else found it.\" Long says it took him hours, spread out over two days, to find the ring in Loose Park Pond, pulling up a couple dozen nails and a toy car before he unearthed what he was looking for on Saturday. Per the Kansas City Star, the ring had already been found when Dixon and Salas appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Tuesday, where they re-created the ill-fated proposal, then accepted a brand-new diamond ring from Kimmel to replace their lost one. (Long says he got in touch with Dixon in California on Monday.) Dixon said in a Facebook post on Wednesday that they alerted Kimmel's staff about Long's discovery once they found out about it—he noted the ring was found while \"Ruth and I have been in Los Angeles\"—and that \"we have been completely honest ... during this entire process.\" He also notes Kimmel and Co. still insisted they keep the ring. \"Now for the next adventure to get married on October 21, 2017!!!!\" Dixon wrote."

The AP reports that the photos were taken in the middle of the raid, and that the SEALs shot bin Laden after they saw him appear to lunge for a weapon, reports NBC News. The SEALs then made their way up a staircase, where they ran into one of bin Laden's sons. The Americans immediately shot and killed the 19-year-old son, who was also unarmed, according to the officials. One SEAL scooped up two young girls and carried them out of harm's way. The other two commandos stormed into bin Laden’s bedroom, where one of the bin Laden wives rushed toward the Navy SEAL, who shot her in the leg. Then, without hesitation, the same commando turned his gun on bin Laden, standing in what appeared to be pajamas, and fired two quick shots, one to the chest and one in the head.

Bin Laden's courier, Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, fired on the Seals as they launched the raid. After he and his wife were shot dead, the Americans weren't fired on again, reports AP. The others were killed because US forces believed they all posed a \"serious threat,\" said a federal source. Initially, White House officials said the special forces came under heavy, prolonged small-arms fire as they moved into bin Laden's hideout. Instead of chaos amidst a hail of gunfire, the team moved methodically from room to room in what the New York Times characterizes as a \"one-sided\" 40-minute operation, confronting bin Laden aides and gathering some 22 children and women, some of whom were placed in plastic handcuffs. The US forces ended up in bin Laden's bedroom, shooting his wife in the leg and the apparently pajama-clad al-Qaeda leader in the head and chest, reports MSNBC. Bin Laden was shot as he appeared to be reaching for a nearby weapon, said a spokesman. CIA Chief Leon Panetta had reported that the men were \"engaged in a firefight throughout the operation.\" White House officials said all details of the raid were not initially clear. \"They were in a threatening and hostile environment the entire time,\" one official told the Times."

Politico notes that the letter probably won't force Obama to do anything, but will definitely get attention. This week is a particularly tense one for the White House: It's very possible the House's decision on whether to hold Holder in contempt will come on the same day as the Supreme Court decision on ObamaCare.

Bunch, 38, was sentenced to 60 years in 1996 for the murder of her 3-year-old son, Tony, in a fire that killed him. But on Wednesday, she was released pending a trial that was granted in March by the Indiana Court of Appeals. The Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University School of Law took up Bunch's case in 2007 and was joined in the cause by Chicago attorney Ron Safer, whose Schiff Hardin firm worked on the case at no cost. In 2009, they presented new evidence to the appeals court based, in part, on technological advances in fire investigations. The new evidence, Safer says, made it impossible for the fire to have happened the way the state alleged, that some test results the state provided were simply incorrect. Had the fire been set with an accelerant in the manner prosecutors alleged, he would have died from burns. The judge said the words she and her family had waited 16 years to hear: \"The defendant will be released from the Department of Corrections.\"",

She got 60 years for supposedly setting the fire that killed her 3-year-old son in 1995, and struggled to find anyone who could help, Mother Jones reports. Finally, lawyers at the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University's law school exposed a glaring hole (and possibly corruption) in the arson investigators' case. That evidence got Bunch released in 2012 after 16 years in prison, USA Today reported at the time. Then two lawyers from the Center, Karen Daniel and Judy Royal, began helping wrongfully convicted women based on a shocking statistic: Women constitute roughly 11% of violent-crime convictions but only 6% of overturned cases. But why are women's cases harder to overturn? Daniel and Royal give their reasons: Women are usually convicted of violent crimes against people close to them (like a husband or son) so DNA evidence won't help; the suspect's DNA is already spread around the crime scene. By contrast, men usually assault or kill strangers. An incredible 63% of women's exoneration cases turn out to be accidents or suicides rather than crimes. So instead of finding a \"real culprit,\" Daniel and Royal may have to laboriously dismantle the prosecutors' case, perhaps with new science on arson or shaken-baby syndrome that not everyone accepts. Sexist stereotypes are used against women in court. In the case of a woman wrongfully convicted of murdering her son, the prosecutor implied she did it to pursue a modeling career. \"That was based on one tiny conversation expressing slight interest in maybe having a nice photo taken,\" says Daniel. \"Almost every case has something like this.\" Click for Mother Jones' full article."

Falcon, 55, was arrested without incident. \"Nobody thought he was in the United States,\" says Barry Golden, a spokesperson for the US Marshals Service, which believed Falcon was living out his days in Mexico or Colombia. Instead, he was renting a forgettable home in a suburb near Disney World. Authorities were tipped off by a fake driver's license used by Falcon during a 2013 car accident. \"We figured this all out a month ago,\" Golden says. Falcon is facing charges of conspiracy to import cocaine. His brother, the former kingpin, is scheduled to be released from prison in June."

The Washington Post reports that scientists from Texas, Arizona, Utah, and Canada analyzed the vocalizations of more than 200 living birds and crocodiles, and found that birds with proportionally larger bodies—think doves, ostriches, and the giant New Zealand cassowary—made the low murmurs. \"Looking at the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization in birds that are alive today could tell us how dinosaurs vocalized,\" says study author Chad Eliason in a press release. \"It was a witches’ brew of baby elephant cries, tiger chuffs, and a gargling alligator, remixed into a cinematically terrifying but completely artificial aural blast.\" The study also found that small birds, like sparrows and finches, did not make the noise, and birds with large bodies—like doves and ostrichets—did, too. The study suggests that dinosaurs may have evolved in different groups of animals, including crocodiles and birds. \"A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that many times, many times",

A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

Giovanni DeGarimore, owner of Giovanni's Fish Market, says he bought the octopus from a fisherman yesterday with the sole intention of releasing him back into the wild. The octopus, which he later named Fred, had disassembled a water recycling valve and directed a tube to spew out of the tank for about 10 hours, the Los Angeles Times reports. \"It found something loose and just pulled on it,\" the aquarium's education manager tells the Times. \"They are very smart creatures.\" The octopuses are known for their ability to adapt to the environment, and the aquarium says it's not clear how long they'll live in the ocean. \"At the end of the day Gio said, 'It might not change the world, but I'm going to do one thing and if it only makes me and Fred happy, that's okay too.'\"",

Giovanni DeGarimore, owner of Giovanni's Fish Market in Morro Bay, bought the 70-pounder earlier this month for a couple hundred dollars from a local crab fisherman who'd caught it by mistake. DeGarimore then named it Fred and released the creature in a secure area without sea lions or other potential risks, the San Luis Obispo Tribune reports. So why this octopus love when DeGarimore makes a living selling fish? \"It's just been a culmination of events through the last 10 years,\" says DeGarimore, who recalls how a cousin once bought a live octopus from a sushi restaurant and set it free. \"She was kind of my inspiration.\" DeGarimore also encountered an octopus while scuba diving in Fiji and marveled at its intelligence. \"Essentially, we played a game of hide and seek for 15 minutes under the ocean,\" he says. (Scientific American has reported on octopuses' smarts and the Tribune on their ability to wiggle away.)

William McCormack is suing the hospital and the surgeon who said he removed McCormack's appendix, the Journal News reports. McCormack says he experienced severe stomach pains during a March visit to Lake Placid and underwent an emergency operation. During the second operation, \"it was discovered that (McCormack's) appendix was never removed and was still inside him,\" court papers say. The lawsuit claims McCormack suffered a \"yellowish mass,\" not his appendix, and that the hospital ignored his request to go under the knife. The hospital says it is investigating McCormack’s claim and does not comment on pending litigation. A lawyer for McCormack, who is seeking unspecified damages from Lawrence Hospital and Dr. Michael Kerin, says the lawsuit “speaks for itself.” Kerin's website lists Kerin as former director of surgery at Lawrence Hospital.",

        "prediction": "– President Obama is expected to veto a spending bill that would fund federal agencies through Dec. 15, the Wall Street Journal reports. The House voted early Sunday to approve a plan that would also include conditions related to the new federal health law. Those conditions include delay the start of the health law for one year and repeal the law’s tax on medical devices, the Hill reports. Democrats say they will reject any changes to the law, and President Obama would veto such a bill. Republicans have a powerful incentive to continue to press his party's fight against the law: Conservatives in the House Republican conference are clamoring for a confrontation over it, and they have the votes to make trouble for Mr. Boehner on this and many other fiscal matters. But Republicans believe there is some chance that the Senate will agree to repeal the medical device tax, giving the House GOP a victory. Test votes earlier this year in the Senate showed broad, bipartisan support for the repeal. However, the leading Democratic proponent of the repeal—Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota—has said she does not favor tacking it onto the spending bill. Senate leadership aides say they are confident they have enough votes to beat the amendment.",
        "reference": "– Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The New York Times calls it \"a major environmental victory for the Obama administration,\" and SCOTUSblog agrees that it's a \"clear victory for the EPA.\" The result is that about 1,000 power plants will have to put into place new pollution controls to limit nitrogen and sulfur emissions, reports the Guardian. The problem of air pollution blowing from coal-burning states into states downwind—think Ohio and Kentucky vs. Connecticut and New York—is a complex one, Ginsburg wrote, and the EPA must have the leeway to deal with the \"vagaries of the wind.\" She thinks the EPA got it right with its current formula, though Antonin Scalia disagreed in his dissent. The case, he wrote, underscores \"the major problem that many citizens have with the federal government these days: that they are governed not so much by their elected representatives as by an unelected bureaucracy operating under vague statutory standards.”"

The British Library has tested the spectacles, which are all convex or \"plus\" lenses, and they're much stronger than the others, the Telegraph reports.

The study, published in Scientific Reports, also found that the three pairs of glasses—which are convex to the eye—are much stronger, and that they would have been worn by someone longsighted. \"Jane Austen is known to have had problems with her eyes,\" says an optometrist. \"She complained in several letters about her 'weak' eyes,\" he says. \"Perhaps it was because of a more serious underlying health problem. Diabetes is one such condition, because it can induce cataracts. A gradually developing cataract would mean that an individual would need a stronger, stronger prescription, over time.\"",

The legendary author's own letters complain of ill health, and experts have used them to suggest a number of possible culprits, from stomach cancer to Hodgkin's lymphoma, the Washington Post reports. Now, a trio of eyeglasses found in Austen's desk could hold a more intriguing answer. The spectacles of increasing strength indicate Austen suffered from progressive eye problems; indeed, the Pride and Prejudice author notes her \"weak\" eyes in her missives. Austen may have suffered from an underlying health problem that attacked her vision, writes British Library curator Sandra Tuppen, who theorizes slow-growing cataracts might have been caused by accidental arsenic poisoning. The toxic metal was common in 19th-century England, tainting medicine, water, and even wallpaper. Other causes such as diabetes would have killed Austen more quickly, says Tuppen. The debate over Austen's death dates back to 1964, when an English doctor argued the culprit was the adrenal disorder Addison's disease. Then crime writer Lindsay Ashford floated the arsenic theory in a 2011 novel, citing the skin discoloration that Austin notes late in her life. \"I think it’s highly likely she was given a medicine containing arsenic,\" says Ashford. \"When you look at her list of symptoms and compare them to the list of arsenic symptoms, there is an amazing correlation.\" But Austen scholar Janine Barchas, who has her own forthcoming report on the glasses, calls the arsenic theory \"reckless,\" per the New York Times. \"We look forward to further discussions and debate on this topic,\" writes Tuppen.

Russia, Syria's arms supplier and ally, immediately embraced Mr. Kerry’s suggestion on Monday, the New York Times reports. “If the establishment of international control over chemical weapons in the country will prevent attacks, then we will immediately begin work with Damascus,” Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said, according to the Wall Street Journal. \"And we call on the Syrian leadership to not only agree to setting the chemical weapons storage sites under international control, but also to their subsequent destruction.” The White House says it's worth taking a “hard look” at the proposal, but the Obama administration has good reason to be skeptical of any promises made by the Assad regime or its Russian backers. Assad will need to allow monitors into the country immediately. That would be a gesture to the world that his government will abide by international laws against chemical weapons use. The Russians will have to work closely with the United States and the United Nations",

Some of the opinions: It's a 'sham': That's the view of Michael Doran of the Brookings Institution as quoted in the Washington Post. \"This is a dishonest ploy by Russia and Syria that boxes in the Unites States and, more importantly, makes any relief for Syria’s civil war far less likely,\" writes Max Fisher, summing up Doran's view. The worst part is that President Obama must now rely on Vladimir Putin and Bashar al-Assad. \"He is their partner in this sham process,\" says Doran. Later, he asks: \"When we rush to embrace rivals and enemies, what signal does that send, around the Middle East, about our resolve and reliability?\" Worth pursuing: Be skeptical, yes, but the US \"should pursue this potential solution,\" write the editors at the New York Times. Done right—which means requiring Assad to allow monitors in immediately—this \"could mean that the United States would not have to go it alone in standing firm against the Syrian regime. And it could open up a broader channel to a political settlement between Mr. Assad and the rebels—the only practical way to end this war.\" Desperate times: \"It is a long-shot proposal started perhaps by accident, promoted by parties who have regularly lied, and cautiously embraced by a US administration whose policies in Syria have been incoherent by any measure,\" writes David Rothkopf at CNN. \"Regardless of whether it amounts to anything or not, it speaks volumes about how bad our options are.\" Hail Putin: It's Putin, not Obama, who deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, writes KT McFarland at Fox News, who expects Obama to take full credit for the proposal when he speaks tonight. \"It turns out that leading from behind left a big opening up front.

The Western Maryland Initiative, a group led by Scott Strzelczyk, is looking to break off the five western counties from the rest of the state, the Washington Post reports.

With about 650,000 residents, they make up just 11% of the state's population; that's about the size of DC, notes Think Progress. Strzelczyk envisions a state—called Western Maryland or West Maryland, reports the Sentinel—with more \"personal liberty, less government intrusion.\" He's personally pro-gun, anti-Department of Education, and OK with medical marijuana. \"If you don’t belong in [the Democratic] party, you’ll never have your views represented\" in Maryland, says Strzelczyk. \"If we have more states, we can all go live in states that best represent us, and then we can get along.\" (He doesn't want to move to another state, however.)

Now, also for the Hollywood Reporter, Baum unravels what he believes is likely the iconic blonde's true identity, publishing yearbook photos, marriage certificates, and more. The woman who's adorned hundreds of billboards across LA since the 1980s under the one-name pseudonym Angelyne—she's been called a precursor to other \"famous for being famous\" celebrities like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian—appears to have started off as Ronia Tamar Goldberg. She came to California in 1959 by way of Israel, and her mother died of cancer at the age of 44 when Goldberg, who upon arrival to LA became Renee, was just 14. Baum reached out to Goldberg's alleged younger sister, now Annette Block, and her husband, as well as an ex-husband and a stepsister, all of whom are generally hazy on details if willing to talk at all. Angelyne, for her part, has gone on AirTalk with host Larry Mantle to claim that the story contains \"a lot of inaccuracies\" and that the \"vindictive\" piece can never change the fact that she is \"not a woman\" but \"an icon.\" Indeed, she ran for mayor of Hollywood in 2008, per the Washington Post, and came in 28th out of 135 candidates; she also ran for governor of California in 2003 and, of course, has made numerous paid appearances at events and is the subject of a documentary.

It would likely provoke a sharp reaction from lawmakers, who have said they'd oppose the move, the New York Times reports.

Lawmakers are strongly against the move, which \"would ignite a political firestorm, even if it's the best resolution for the Guantanamo problem,\" a law professor explains. You might recall that a previous use of executive power could soon see the president sued. But White House officials say Obama is \"unwavering in his commitment\" to move Gitmo's 149 inmates and close the prison's doors, something the president apparently sees as key to his legacy. What will Obama do? Well, he has two options, the Journal points out. One: He vetoes the National Defense Authorization Act, which includes the ban on transferring detainees to the US, after the midterm elections. Two: He signs the bill but argues the ban infringes on his powers as commander in chief. While officials won't say to which US facilities the prisoners would shift—the Journal reports Charleston's military brig seems likely—Obama will likely lessen the blow by moving some of the 79 detainees cleared for transfer to places outside the US; Estonia, for example, has already agreed to accept one prisoner, and other European countries are willing. That isn't likely to please many, however. The most recent Gallup poll on the issue finds 66% of Americans want Guantanamo to stay open."

An hour after that, Trump tweeted condolences to the family, as well as his \"thoughts and prayers.\" He went on to call Wade a \"great guy\" during a rally Saturday in Iowa. Trump was widely accused of crassly exploiting a tragedy. Actor Don Cheadle was particularly outspoken, calling Trump \"truly a POS\" and requesting he \"die in a grease fire.\" Tim Kaine also called Trump out for the tweet, saying sympathy is the \"only reaction that is appropriate right now.\" A recent poll showed Trump with only 1% support among black voters. The New York Times reports he's been trying to change that by talking about how bad life is for black people in the US and asking, \"What the hell do you have to lose?\" Many saw Saturday's tweet as a sequel of sorts to when Trump tweeted \"appreciate the congrats\" following the massacre at an Orlando gay club."

(He got perhaps the biggest applause line of the night with this line: \"My neighbor's two dogs have created more shovel-ready projects for this country\" than Obama.)

Romney responded: \"There's a Rick Perry out there that's saying the federal government shouldn't be in the pension business. You better find that Rick Perry and get him to stop saying that.\" Perry then accused Romney of changing views of his Massachusetts health care law in different versions of his book, and later widened the flip-flopping charges to a host of other issues.

Immigration also emerged as a main issue, with Romney, Michele Bachmann, and Rick Santorum criticizing the Texas policy of giving in-state tuition benefits to immigrants' kids, notes Politico.

Well, the Week explains, William Bradford's journals were rediscovered and reprinted in 1856, and he wrote about the wild turkey hunts the colonists engaged in in 1621. Plus, turkey is a very American bird, and a large enough one to feed a table full of people, so when Abraham Lincoln officially made Thanksgiving a national holiday in 1863, that's what was on the menu. The pilgrims didn't eat cranberry sauce, either, considering sugar was a luxury at the time and it's kind of an integral ingredient in the sauce. (They may have eaten plain cranberries, though; National Geographic notes that the fruit was a sort of Native American \"superfood.\") And neither sweet potatoes nor white potatoes were around in America quite yet, so those weren't on the menu either, nor was pumpkin pie—since the pilgrims probably didn't have the butter or flour they would have needed to make the crust.

On Sunday afternoon, Alyssa Milano tweeted: \"If you've been sexually harassed or assaulted write 'me too' as a reply to this tweet.\" This quickly led to the #MeToo hashtag and a tsunami of posts that simply read \"Me too\" on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, as well as detailed stories from those who felt comfortable sharing more—all messages the Washington Post notes \"were striking in their simplicity, and in the sheer number of them.\" Included among the \"tens of thousands\" the New York Times says reacted to Milano's message were other names from show biz, including Debra Messing, Anna Paquin, and Javier Munoz, from Broadway's Hamilton. \"I don't know if [it] means anything coming from a gay man but it's happened. Multiple times,\" Munoz tweeted. CNN notes that Milano co-starred on Charmed with Rose McGowan, one of Weinstein's most vocal accusers. Milano also penned an essay last week about Weinstein on her Patriot Not Partisan website, noting she's friends with Weinstein's wife, Georgina Chapman, and that even though she's \"sickened and angered\" by the specific allegations against him, \"we must change things in general. We must do better for women everywhere.\""

In the case of a goofy-nasty bad-behavior farce like \"Rough Night,\" directed and co-written by Lucia Aniello, what's novel isn't so much the plot as the spin, the female gaze, the inside-the-club sensibility. That, for all the cookie-cutter elements, is what's fresh about the movie, and why it should find a solid audience. But first, a word on how derivative it is: Rough Night is a \"dumb,nasty, bad-behaving farce,\" writes Peter Travers at the San Francisco Chronicle.

The movie has a lackluster approval rating of about 50% among critics on Rotten Tomatoes, despite big-name stars such as Scarlett Johannson and Kate McKinnon. Samples: Rough Night \"offers a few sight gags that are pure, dumb genius\" and \"is at its best when it catches the precise crosscurrent between sleazy and breezy.\" But when the movie takes a dark turn, \"it starts to fall apart,\" Stephanie Zacharek writes at Time. \"As Hangover-style dumb entertainments go, it's certainly good enough,\" she adds, but she isn't sure this is \"anything close\" to what women want to see. Owen Gleiberman, on the other hand, says Rough Night is \"a perfect example of why Hollywood needs (many) more women filmmakers.\" Though its formula is quite \"derivative,\" its female perspective makes it fresh, he writes at Variety. The best elements: \"the feisty, claws-out spontaneity of its competitive banter between 'sisters' who love and hate each other\" and Jillian Bell, \"the film's comic spark plug.\" Leah Greenblatt was less tickled. Rough Night is \"a raunchy, wildly off-the-rails farce\" that \"feels like the summer-movie equivalent of a fidget spinner: shiny, manic, and spiraling to nowhere,\" she writes at Entertainment Weekly. She does commend the casting—naming Ty Burrell and Demi Moore, who play a swingers couple—but adds the actors have to deal with a \"loose cannon of a script.\" \"Well, at least they got the title right,\" begins Adam Graham at the Detroit News. The rest of his review is no less harsh. \"Rough Night is a dismal, excruciating experience, a tired retread of raunchy comedy tropes that can't be bothered to come up with any funny or original bits,\" he writes.

At the time, trophy hunters believed a person's genius would be apparent in his skull. Rumors also claimed that Shakespeare's skull might be hidden in a sealed crypt at another church nearby, but Colls' team investigated and found the skull there was that of a woman in her 70s. The team also discovered that Shakespeare was buried in a simple shroud, not a coffin, and that he and his wife were buried in shallow graves, not a deeper family vault as had been believed, Newsweek adds.

The allegation drew quite a bit of attention, and apparently Hannity himself was surprised. \"Earlier today my web staff posted content that was not reviewed by me before publication,\" he said in a statement. \"It does not reflect my voice and message and, therefore, I had it taken down.\" The sperm rumor apparently began circulating on 4chan, and the Daily Beast appears to have tracked down the original source, a 2008 article in the New York Times about artist Wiley.

In one study, researchers measured the levels of DEHP, a phthalate found in processed foods, in the urine of 766 adolescents ages 12 to 19. They found that teens with higher amounts of the chemical had increased rates of insulin resistance, a condition that can lead to Type 2 diabetes, LiveScience reports. The results held when the researchers controlled for some other risk factors, such as the teens' calorie intake and weight. The researchers didn't find an association between insulin resistance and other kinds of Phthalates that are found in cosmetics and personal care products such as shampoos. In another study, the researchers found that insulin-resistant teens tended to eat food with higher DEHP content, or that they excreted more DEHP in their urine compared to healthy children. The study doesn't prove a cause-and-effect relationship, but it suggests that people who are obese are merely eating more BPA-containing food, experts say. \"BPA is found in higher concentrations in fat tissue compared to other body tissues, so it is possible that people with more body fat store more",

In one, researchers found that higher levels of DEHP, a phthalate found in processed foods, their packaging, medical equipment, and other products, correlated strongly with greater insulin resistance, a key precursor to diabetes. The other linked the infamous-yet-ubiquitous BPA with obesity, LiveScience reports. The DEHP link held true even after correcting for things like economic status, ethnicity, and glucose levels. \"While dietary sources are likely to be the chief source of exposure, given the uses of DEHP in other products, we cannot rule out nondietary sources,\" researchers wrote, according to Fast Company. But both teams added that their results didn't prove causation, and one doctor commenting on the study complained that they relied on urine analysis, which isn't necessarily indicative of how much of the chemicals remained in the blood."

Maine is one of 19 states where Republicans have blocked Medicaid expansion available under the ACA. The Maine legislature has voted repeatedly to expand Medicaid only to have Gov. Paul LePage veto expansion five times. However, if expansion is approved by voters through a referendum next month, LePage would be unable to veto it. If the referendum passes, approximately 80,000 more Maine residents making up to 138% of the poverty level will be eligible for Medicaid. In addition to decreasing the number of uninsured Maine residents, supporters of the referendum say it will add jobs and help rural hospitals stay open. LePage, while attacking Maine hospitals for their support of the referendum on Friday, said it would take \"resources away from our most vulnerable Mainers\" to \"give free taxpayer-funded healthcare to adults who should be working and contributing,\" the Press Herald reports. Under the ACA, at least 90% of Medicaid expansion costs would be covered by the federal government. The other 18 states where Medicaid expansion has been blocked are carefully watching what happens in Maine.

A witness says that after the boy fell 15 feet into in the enclosure, the gorilla seemed protective at first, but he became agitated as visitors screaming and started dragging the boy through a moat. A witness tells CNN that to get into the enclosure when his mother was distracted, the boy had to \"climb under something, through some bushes and then into the moat.\" He was released from a hospital on Saturday night and his parents issued a statement thanking the zoo and saying the boy is \"doing just fine,\" the Cincinnati Enquirer reports. \"We know that this was a very difficult decision for them, and that they are grieving the loss of their gorilla,\" they said.

        "prediction": "– The Supreme Court has ruled in favor of a Florida school district that uses corporal punishment in violation of its constitutional rights, reports the Washington Post. In Ingraham v. Wright, students in a Dade County, Fla., junior high school filed a complaint against the school, alleging that they had been subjected to punishment by a teacher and principal, who had consulted with the principal or teacher in charge of the school. The school board then authorized the punishment after the teacher consulted with school officials, specifying that the punishment was not to be \"degrading or unduly severe,\" reports the Post. The district court granted the students' motion to dismiss the complaint, finding no basis for constitutional relief, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. The court's decision is based on two key points: The Eighth Amendment doesn't apply to corporal punishments in public schools, and it doesn't require notice and hearing prior to imposition of punishment. \"The history of the Eighth Amendment and the decisions of this Court make it clear that the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment was designed to protect those convicted of crime,\" the court wrote. \"There is no need to wrench [the Eighth Amendment] from its historical context and extend it to public school disciplinary practices",

The Education Department's Office for Civil Rights has found that almost 19,000 children—2.5% of the state's students—got paddled in public schools during the 2013-2014 school year, reports AL.com. Boys get hit more than girls, and black children were paddled at a disproportionate rate compared to whites. It's a long-standing (and legal) disciplinary tradition in the state that locals don't seem terribly motivated to change: The National Education Association wants the practice banned, but the Alabama Education Association has stayed mum—despite the fact that it's illegal to paddle an adult in the state, per an opinion piece on AL.com. UNICEF's \"Violence Against Children\" report doesn't exactly support paddling enthusiasts, noting that studies have linked corporal punishment to poor mental health, social issues, and academic problems. And many educational and child advocacy groups, including the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, agree it's ill-advised. But a 1977 Supreme Court decision ruled corporal punishment was not cruel and unusual and that schools could decide whether to use it—and in 1995, Alabama lawmakers gave public schools the right to do so. Most of the states that allow paddling (21 states reported it in the 2013-'14 school year) are in the South. (Fifty years of spanking studies analyzed here.)"

The tick, which is also known as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, has been spotted in the southeastern US and is spreading to other tick species, as well as in Pennsylvania and New York. While the tick's range isn't clear, researchers are pretty sure that it's tick bites that are causing the allergies to meat and cetuximab, notes Wired. As far as scientists know, this condition is lifelong. Unfortunately, the reaction is life-threatening, too, as anaphylaxis can cause a person's airway to swell shut.",

Experts say the lone star tick appears to be spreading from its home base in the southeastern US. Whereas other ticks can spread ailments such as Lyme disease, the lone star tick is bothersome because it is believed to trigger a potentially life-threatening and apparently lifelong meat allergy with its bite. The tick doesn't technically make people allergic to meat, but rather to a sugar molecule found in red meat known as alpha-gal. This alpha-gal allergy has typically been limited to the southeastern US, where the lone star tick is prevalent, but no more, reports Wired. Cases—in which the consumption of meat can result in hives, difficulty breathing, or death—have been reported in Minnesota, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and New York, per Inverse. Long Island has seen at least 100 cases in the last year. Researchers suspect the spread of the allergy coincides with the spread of lone star ticks, though it's also possible that other ticks are responsible. Either way, \"the nuisance level [for lone star ticks] is much higher than the black-legged tick,\" an expert tells the Weston Forum. \"It is aggressive and very abundant.\" Researchers are currently studying the effect of a lone star tick bite on mice to determine why it triggers the allergy.

        "reference": "– Reactions are flying in to the Supreme Court's decision to strike down much of Arizona's immigration law, but one of the most extreme came from the court itself. Speaking in dissent of the ruling, Antonin Scalia questioned whether Arizona and other states would have even joined the union if they'd known today's ruling was coming, Politico reports. He said the ruling particularly \"boggles the mind\" in light of Obama's recent executive order on immigration. He said delegates at the constitutional convention would have \"rushed to the exits\" at the thought of Obama's move. But while Scalia may have been incensed, seemingly every other quarter was declaring victory, or at least partial victory. For example: Jan Brewer called it a \"victory for the rule of law,\" and for the 10th Amendment, because \"the heart of SB 1070 can now be implemented,\" meaning the provision requiring police to check the immigration status of people stopped for other crimes. Joe Arpaio agreed. \"I think this is a good section that's been upheld,\" he said, though he lamented the loss of \"the authority to arrest illegal aliens just by being there illegally.\" President Obama said he was also \"pleased\" with the decision, which \"makes unmistakably clear (that) Congress must act on comprehensive immigration reform,\" but said he was still \"concerned\" about the remaining provision, according to CNN. Mitt Romney's statement, meanwhile, was decidedly vague. \"Today's decision underscores the need for a president who will lead on this critical issue,\" he said. \"President Obama has failed to provide any leadership on immigration.\" He said every state has a duty and right to secure its borders, but offered no explicit opinion on the ruling itself."

It wasn't exactly a firm statement, with the Newsmax CEO saying that Trump is \"considering perhaps terminating\" Mueller, who is looking into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. He added: \"I think he's weighing that option.\" That prompted a quick response from White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who said that Ruddy \"never spoke to the president regarding this issue\" and that \"only the president or his attorneys are authorized to comment.” Related coverage: Who's Ruddy?

It might mean that he'd have to fire deputy AG Rod Rosenstein, too, the man who appointed Mueller in the first place.

A post at Lawfare on Friday called the hire \"the worst thing that happened to Donald Trump this week,\" because it signaled an aggressive investigation. Overplayed?

The WDFW is now asking for the public's help in scooping the escaped fish out of the waters near Cypress Island (or wherever they may turn up), with no size or quantity restrictions.

Still, some in the administration and outside it were hopeful that his declaration would create pressure on Iran and America's partners in that deal—Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and China—to negotiate a new agreement in which Iran abandons its ballistic missile development, funding of terrorist groups, stated quest to destroy Israel, and cyber-attacks on the US and its allies. \"Without proof that Iran is in violation of the agreement, it is a mistake to fully withdraw from this deal,\" said Rep.

Some commentators say the leak may have been planned to devalue Thursday's launch, which will be assisted by decidedly non-church-affiliated professionals, including an atheist scientist and an economist, per the AP. (This isn't the first ugly Vatican leak.)"

        "prediction": "– NASA's Nutritional Biochemistry Lab is investigating the impact spaceflight has on astronauts' health, reports the Washington Post. The study, published in the journal Human Adaptation to Spaceflight: The Role of Nutrition, looks at the effects of spaceflight on the body, including bone and muscle loss, cardiovascular degradation, impairment of immune function, neurovestibular changes, and vision changes. \"We need to make sure we understand the body's requirements for nutrients, that the food system has those nutrients, and that they are stable over the duration of a long spaceflight,\" says the study's lead author, Scott M. Smith. In the study, astronauts provide blood and urine samples before, during, and after their space missions, and the results are stored in a database for researchers to extrapolate key factors used to improve efforts to enhance nutrition health on space missions. \"Nutrition is vital to the mission,\" says Smith. \"Without proper nutrition for the astronauts, the mission will fail. It's that simple.\" The study also looks at how the human body changes with longer exposures to microgravity and higher radiation doses. \"The food system will be of utmost importance for combatting these effects from long-duration missions,\" Smith",
        "reference": "– A ship's chaplain in the 1740s wrote of sailors' gums that would grow out of control until they protruded from the mouth and rotted away, leaving a horrific case of bad breath, the BBC reports. So it turns out that not only was scurvy once incredibly dangerous, it was also super gross. Real Clear Science reports that approximately 2 million sailors died from scurvy, which is caused by a lack of vitamin C, between 1500 and 1800. During his voyage across the Pacific, Magellan lost 80% of his crew to the disease called \"the plague of the sea,\" according to the BBC. One historian says scurvy killed more sailors than battle, storms, shipwrecks, and other diseases combined. And, it wasn't a pleasant way to go, either. Scurvy starts with lethargy before causing achy joints, swollen limbs, and loose teeth, according to Real Clear Science. From there, sufferers get swollen gums, bad breath, and bruising. The skin turns yellow, then black, just before sufferers die from internal hemorrhaging. The tragic part is scurvy is ridiculously easy to cure. Real Clear Science reports someone on the brink of death from the disease could be saved by eating one-fifth of an orange every day for a week. Alas, doctors of the time didn't know what vitamins were, and ships weren't exactly built to store fresh fruit. The disease is mostly gone now, but a post at Phys.org notes that NASA scientists are using the lessons learned to ensure astronauts get the vitamins they need to stay healthy in space. (Is it possible kids are getting too many vitamins?)"

        "prediction": "– An 11-year-old boy was found dead in a closet in a Los Angeles home on Aug. 22, the Los Angeles Times reports. Yonatan Daniel Aguilar weighed just 34 pounds when he was found, wrapped in a blanket, lying on a hard tile floor inside a bedroom closet in the Echo Park home. Sources close to the investigation tell CBS Los Angeles that the closet was so small, Yonotan couldn't stretch out his legs. The boy's stepfather, Jose Pinzon, had been told previously by Aguilar that she sent Yonatan to Mexico to live with family, and he hadn't seen the boy in years, according to court documents obtained by the Times. Aguilar told Pinzon that Yonatan lived with his maternal grandmother until age 3, and that he was likely deprived of food during that time and developed the habit of hoarding food, the Times notes. But officials with the county Department of Children and Family Services—which had responded to six reports of possible abuse or neglect involving the family from 2009 to 2012 and marked the boy's risk of abuse \"high\" four times—had no further contact. After claiming allegations of abuse were inconclusive or unfounded, social workers never formally opened a case",
        "reference": "– Police found Yonatan Daniel Aguilar dead in the bedroom closet of his family's Los Angeles home in August—and authorities say the malnourished boy, who was 11 years old but weighed just 34 pounds, had been hidden away in locked closets for three years. He was last seen publicly in 2012, at which time teachers reported that he had come to school with a black eye and seemed hungry. After that, his 39-year-old mother, Veronica Aguilar, told almost everyone, including Yonatan's stepfather, that she had sent the boy to an institution in Mexico, the Los Angeles Times reports. Yonatan was reportedly autistic and had issues with soiling himself. Authorities say that only his three siblings knew Aguilar was keeping him sedated with sleeping aids and locked in closets, some of them so small he couldn't stretch out his feet, per Fox 59. In the years prior to his vanishing from public life, Yonatan's family had been reported to DCFS six times for possible abuse or neglect; Yonatan's risk of abuse at home was gauged as \"high\" four times in the three years before he disappeared. But social workers never opened a case, and Aguilar, who volunteered at her kids' school, apparently convinced everyone nothing was amiss, CBS LA reports. \"We talked to the school nurse, the school doctors, school counselors, the teachers, everyone, including the LAPD investigators, who all said everything was OK,\" says the DCFS director, who adds that social workers are \"distraught\" at Yonatan's death. The boy's mother has pleaded not guilty to his murder. Police say his stepfather had no idea Yonatan was hidden in the family home, and he alerted police when his wife brought him to the boy's body."

        "prediction": "– Mitt Romney's campaign has been pushing for an earlier date for the Nevada caucuses, and the New Hampshire secretary of state is threatening to move the state's primary from Jan. 14 to Dec. 13, reports the Las Vegas Review-Journal and the Des Moines Register. But New Hampshire's laws require that the state’s primary be held on a Tuesday, that it occur before any other primary (but not necessarily any other caucus), and that there is a full week's buffer between it and the next nomination contest. So chances are that a December date would diminish the importance of New Hampshire from an electoral perspective, both because it is so disconnected from the rest of the calendar and because Mr. Romney's rivals might have more of an excuse for a poor performance there. Candidates like Mr. Perry and Herman Cain could cite the difficulty of competing in New Hampshire on a compressed schedule, and against a candidate in the state and is something of a native son. The news media, annoyed that the earlier date would require them to revisit their own plans, might be happy to play along.",
        "reference": "– New Hampshire may be forced to hold its GOP primary as early as Dec. 6, and it will be all Nevada's fault for moving up its caucus date, the Granite State's top election official warns. Secretary of State William Gardner says New Hampshire has no intention of surrendering its tradition of being the second state to choose a nominee, and the combination of state laws and the Christmas holiday make Dec. 6 or 13 the only realistic dates for a primary if Nevada refuses to move its date back by at least three days, Politico reports. Iowa's caucus is set for Jan. 3, and Nevada's is schedule for Jan. 14. The parties \"can discourage other states from trying to leapfrog onto our tradition,\" Gardner said in a statement. \"Right now, the problem is the date of Nevada. We cannot allow the political process to squeeze us into a date that wedges us by just a few days between two major caucus states.\" Mitt Romney is expected to win in both New Hampshire and Nevada, but an early December win in New England will leave a long time, and probably a big loss in Iowa, between victories, notes Nate Silver at the New York Times."

        "prediction": "– The mother of a Ladue High School junior who did not make the varsity soccer team says she believes her son is the victim of age and sex discrimination because she says the rules are different for the girls' soccer team. The coach sent the family an email that said their son was on the bubble when it came to picking varsity team members. He wrote the boy has holes in his technical ability and game decision making. The family appealed the coach's ruling to the superintendent, who decided the family's complaint was unsubstantiated, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. The mother's attorney says the issue is age and gender discrimination because her son, who already played on the J.V soccer team, is good enough to play again on the same team. In the courtroom testimony, the coach indicated the seven juniors cut from the Varsity team were not good enough for the JV team. He said the reason he said nice things about John Doe was to build his self-esteem and not punch him in the gut. The lawyer for John Doe also introduced documents that he said show players performance ratings given by coaches show that John Doe is better than some of the boys who made varsity.",
        "reference": "– After her 16-year-old son failed to make the varsity soccer team, a disappointed mother went a step or two further than most parents might. She filed a lawsuit in federal court, alleging that the teen is a victim of age and gender discrimination, Fox 2 reports. The family says the rules at Missouri's Ladue High School state that if a junior doesn't make it onto the varsity team, he can't play again on the junior varsity team; that way, students in lower grades can use the JV team to develop the skills they need to try out for varsity. The family wants the boy placed on the JV team, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. They first appealed the coach's decision to district administrators and the superintendent, both of whom sided with the coach; they then complained to the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights, but ultimately sued because the office had no power to force the school to place the boy on a team. The boy reportedly wanted to take the case to federal court. The family's lawsuit claims that the girls' soccer team does allow juniors to play on JV, which is where the sex discrimination comes in. \"There are many schools across the country that have this policy that you either make varsity as a junior or you're out of the program,\" says the boy's stepfather, who is also one of the lawyers handling the case. \"If someone said 'Cut all the blacks,' that would be illegal. And it's illegal for age too.\" He adds that per stats and rankings, the boy should have made varsity. But the coach testified in court that the only reason he said positive things about the boy's skills was to build up his self-esteem rather than making him feel worse after he had already failed to make the team, and he also testified that the school doesn't actually have a policy preventing juniors from playing on JV teams. He said it depends how many spots there are on the team and how many kids want to play. The judge is set to decide Monday."
